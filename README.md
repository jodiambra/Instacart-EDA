## Purpose
This project analyzes data collected by Instacart, the grocery delivery platform. The purpose of this project is to clean up the data, and use the cleaned data to report insights on shopping habits of Instacart customers. The data  was cleaned by removing duplicate vales, and filling in missing values, all while maintaining the integrity of the dataset. Analyses indicated the number of orders placed, dependent on variables such as time of the day, day of the week, and time since the customer last placed an order. The results demonstrate the distribution of the number of orders customers place, the top 20 products, and the top 20 reordered products. 

## Conclusions
After cleaning the data from duplicates and missing values, we were able to develop key insights on the Instacart platform. Using the several datasets provided by the company, we were able to illustrate the distribution of orders by the day of the week, and by the time of day. We saw that most orders were made on Sunday, and the least, on Wednesday. We also determined, when considering Wednesday and Saturday data, most orders were made during the middle of the day, with the amount tailing off in the late evening. Hardly any orders were made in the early morning, until around 7 am, on Wednesday or Saturday. These results suggest a probable correlation with typical sleep times. As such, resources should be implemented in the appropriate time frames, to maximize the amount of drivers available for deliveries. We determined the most popular products, as well as the most popular items reordered and placed in the cart first. These products were perishables: fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Overall, we saw that most reorders were made after 30 days, and also within 7 days. Local peaks in reorders appeared in 7 day increments, yet not many orders were placed in between those weekly time frames.
