## Purpose
This project analyzes data collected by Instacart, the grocery delivery platform. The purpose of this project is to clean up the data, and use the cleaned data to report insights on shopping habits of Instacart customers. The data  was cleaned by removing duplicate vales, and filling in missing values, all while maintaining the integrity of the dataset. Analyses indicated the number of orders placed, dependent on variables such as time of the day, day of the week, and time since the customer last placed an order. The results demonstrate the distribution of the number of orders customers place, the top 20 products, and the top 20 reordered products.
